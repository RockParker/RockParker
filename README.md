- 👋 Hi, I’m @RockParker
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Science, and I enjoy gaming, it is my dream to program something like and application or a website that provides meaningful benefit to a large audience. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and I love it
- 💞️ I would love to have more experience collaborating with other individuals or as a team. So if you think I could add something to your project or if you think you   could add something to one of mine, I would enjoy the collaboration.
